# microservices-dashboard

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to visualize links between microservices and the encompassing ecosystem.
This AngularJS application consumes endpoints exposed by [microservices-dashboard-server](https://github.com/ordina-jworks/microservices-dashboard-server).
It displays four columns: UI, Resources, Microservices and Backends.
Each of these columns show nodes and links between them.
Currently only resources, microservices and backends are supported, although the UI-part is almost complete.
The information for these links come from Spring Boot Actuator health endpoints and hypermedia indexes, which are aggregated in the [microservices-dashboard-server](https://github.com/ordina-jworks/microservices-dashboard-server) project.

## Building from source

First a basic build should be done:
```
npm install
```
Then bower dependencies should be installed:
```
bower install
```

## Running

Use gulp to serve the resources using the configuration file:
```
gulp serve:conf
```

Note:

The server needs to be started to get any data in the dashboard: [microservices-dashboard-server](https://github.com/ordina-jworks/microservices-dashboard-server)
