== Microservices Dashboard

== Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a server implementation for the Microservices Dashboard UI project.
This implementation is for now only supporting Spring Boot microservices.
It will query other Spring Boot applications for their actuator endpoints (such as ```/health```) to get information on their status and their dependencies.
After gathering these details from all available applications, it will aggregate these into a single snapshot.
This snapshot can be retrieved by the Microservices Dashboard UI application.

== Reference documentation

To learn everything there is to know about the Microservices Dashboard Server, please consult the http://ordina-jworks.github.io/microservices-dashboard-server/[reference documentation].

== Building from source

The Microservices Dashboard Server requires Java 8 or later and is built using maven:

```bash
./mvnw install
```

== Contributing

Ordina's Microservices Dashboard Server is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license, and follows a very standard GitHub development process, using GitHub tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master.
If you want to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but follow the guidelines below.

=== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant {github-raw}/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[code of conduct].
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
Please report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.
They can also be added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use our code format conventions.
  If you use Eclipse you can import {github-raw-master}/checkstyle/eclipse/eclipse-code-formatter.xml[the formatter settings] using the `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file.
  If using IntelliJ, you can use the http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions].
  If you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit message (where XXXX is the issue number).

=== Checkstyle

This project comes with a set of checkstyle rules.
You can find them in the `checkstyle` directory.

.projectRoot
----
└── checkstyle
    ├── checkstyle.xml <1>
    ├── checkstyle-header.txt <2>
    ├── checkstyle-suppressions.xml <3>
    ├── import-control.xml <4>
----
<1> Default Checkstyle rules
<2> File header setup
<3> Default suppression rules
<4> Default import rules

==== Checkstyle configuration

Checkstyle rules are *enabled by default*, but the build will not fail when there are validation errors.
However, to keep this project maintainable we will change this in the near future.

If you need to suppress some rules, then it's enough for you to make changes to `checkstyle-suppressions.xml` with your suppressions. Example:

.projectRoot/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppresions.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE suppressions PUBLIC
		"-//Puppy Crawl//DTD Suppressions 1.1//EN"
		"http://www.puppycrawl.com/dtds/suppressions_1_1.dtd">
<suppressions>
	<suppress files=".+Application\.java" checks="HideUtilityClassConstructor" />
	<suppress files=".+Configuration\.java" checks="HideUtilityClassConstructor" />
	<suppress files="[\\/]src[\\/]test[\\/]java[\\/]" checks="Javadoc*" />
	<suppress files="[\\/]autoconfigure[\\/]" checks="JavadocType" />
	<suppress files="[\\/]autoconfigure[\\/]" checks="JavadocVariable" />
</suppressions>

=== IDE setup

==== IntelliJ IDEA

In order to setup IntelliJ you should import our coding conventions, inspection profiles and set up the checkstyle plugin.

.Code style

image::{github-raw-master}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-code-style.png[Code style]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `Code style`.
There click on the icon next to the `Scheme` section.
There, click on the `Import Scheme` value and pick the `IntelliJ IDEA code style XML` option.
Import the `checkstyle/intellij/IntelliJ_Ordina_Java_Conventions.xml` file.

.Inspection profiles

image::{github-raw-master}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-inspections.png[Inspection profiles]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `Inspections`.
There click on the icon next to the `Profile` section.
There, click on the `Import Profile` and import the `checkstyle/intellij/IntelliJ_Project_Defaults.xml` file.

.Checkstyle

To have IntelliJ work with Checkstyle, you have to install the `Checkstyle` plugin.
It's advisable to also install the `Assertions2Assertj` to automatically convert the JUnit assertions

image::{github-raw-master}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-checkstyle.png[Checkstyle]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Other settings` -> `Checkstyle`.
There click on the `+` icon in the `Configuration file` section.
There, you'll have to define where the checkstyle rules should be picked from.
In the image above, we've picked the rules from the cloned repository.
However, you can point to the project's GitHub repository (e.g. for the `checkstyle.xml` : `{github-raw-master}/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`).
We need to provide the following variables:

- `checkstyle.header.file` - the ASF license header template
  Please point it to the `checkstyle/checkstyle-header.txt` file either in your cloned repo or via the `{github-raw}/checkstyle/checkstyle-header.txt` URL.
- `checkstyle.import.control.file` - import control rules.
  Please point it to the `checkstyle/import-control.xml` file either in your cloned repo or via the `{github-raw-master}/checkstyle/import-control.xml` URL.
- `checkstyle.suppressions.file` - checkstyle suppressions.
  Please point it to the `checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` file either in your cloned repo or via the `{github-raw-master}/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` URL.

IMPORTANT: Remember to set the `Scan Scope` to `All sources` since we apply checkstyle rules for production and test sources.
